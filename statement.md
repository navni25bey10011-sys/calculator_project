#  Basic Calculator

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to design and develop a simple calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations.  
The system should take user input, process the required operation, and display accurate results.


## Scope of the Project
- The calculator will perform four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- It will accept numeric inputs from the user.  
- The system will handle invalid inputs and division-by-zero errors.  
- The architecture will be modular to allow future enhancements.


## Target Users
- Students learning programming  
- Beginners practicing Python  
- Users needing a simple command-line calculator  


## High-Level Features
- Modular structure using multiple Python files  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Clean function-based operation separation  
- Clear input–processing–output workflow  


## Functional Requirements
- Accept two numerical inputs
- Accept operator (+, -, *, /)
- Validate inputs
- Perform arithmetic operation
- Display result
